## 🔒 Authentication

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The token is stored in localStorage and is automatically included in API requests.

### Protected Routes

Protected routes are implemented using the `ProtectedRoute` component, which checks for user authentication before rendering the protected content.

## 🎨 Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with custom configurations in `tailwind.config.js`. Common styles are managed through the `StyleHelper.ts` file.

## 🚨 Error Handling

- Custom error boundary for runtime errors
- 404 page for non-existent routes
- Form validation using Yup
- API error handling with toast notifications

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Mobile devices
- Tablets
- Desktop computers

## 🔄 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API using Axios. API calls are organized in the `Services` directory.

## 🧪 Development

```bash
npm run dev
